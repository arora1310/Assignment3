TASK 1

In this task we find factorial of number by defining a function then call a function to take output as a factorial,first we take a number input from a user in integer form then form andinitialised variable fact ,then define a function factorial then write code to take factorial of number and return function value in fact then call factorial function to make an output.


TASK 2

In this task we perrform some math modules functions on a number for this first,we import math module then we take a number input from user in form of int then perform operation by using math module functions like math.sqrt to find square root ,math.log to find logarithm and math.sin to find sine and then print their value.
